## Tech

I used these libraries, frameworks and databases for this project

- Cloudinary - to store static files
- Dbdiagram  - used for the database schema diagram
- GitHub - was used as a remote repository to store project code
- Django AllAuth  - was used for user authentication
- Pillow  - was used for image processing and validation
- Psycopg2  - was used as a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python  
- PostgreSQL - deployed project uses a PostgreSQL database
